# React Task Submission

## Project Overview

This project was created as part of the recruitment process for the Frontend role at Factwise. The goal was to implement users details listing with accordion and search bar.

## Features

- **User Details Listing**: Displays a list of users with their details in an accordion format, allowing users to expand and collapse each section to view individual user details.

- **Search Functionality**: A search bar is included at the top of the page, enabling users to quickly find specific users by typing in their names.

- **Edit User**: Provides an option to edit the details of existing users. Clicking the edit button allows users to update information directly within the application.

- **Delete User**: Includes a delete functionality that enables users to remove a user from the list with a single click. A confirmation prompt ensures that the user really wants to delete the selected user.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring that it works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
